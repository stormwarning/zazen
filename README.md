> Zazen is not “step-by-step meditation”. Rather it is simply the easy and
> pleasant practice of a Buddha, the realisation of the Buddha’s Wisdom. The
> Truth appears, there being no [delusion][]. If you understand this, you are
> completely free, like a dragon that has obtained water or a tiger that
> reclines on a mountain. The [supreme Law][] will then appear of itself, _and
> you will be free of weariness and confusion_.
