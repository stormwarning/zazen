# 座禅

> Zazen is not "step-by-step meditation". Rather it is simply the easy and pleasant practice of a Buddha, the realisation of the Buddha's Wisdom. The Truth appears, there being no [delusion][]. If you understand this, you are completely free, like a dragon that has obtained water or a tiger that reclines on a mountain. The [supreme Law][] will then appear of itself, _and you will be free of weariness and confusion_.
